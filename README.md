# 📝 Description:
Developed a Streamlit-based application to tackle the challenge of food wastage by connecting surplus food providers (restaurants, grocery stores, individuals) with NGOs and people in need. The system integrates SQL for data storage and analysis, Python for processing, and a clean UI for interaction. It ensures efficient redistribution of food, reduces wastage, and contributes to social good.
